# chat

This is a simple chat service made using Go. 

### Usage

To start the server run: 

```
go run server.go
```

By default the server runs on localhost:6666, but you can change the port

```
go run server.go 1234
```

To start the client run: 

```
go run client.go
```

To connect the client to a custom port run:

```
go run client.go 1234
```

### Features

-------------------------
- Login with username
- multiple channels
- presistent messages
- simple TUI
-------------------------

This is just a simple project I made to learn go. I plan on improving this chat and adding more features as I get more experienced with the language.
